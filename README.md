Lithography Experimental App Explained in Electron.js

<sub>The educational resources are provided in English and Spanish.  </sub>

Photolithography is a process used to create patterns on the surface of a material. It is often performed at the nanoscale, where dimensions are measured in nanometers (billionths of a meter). At this scale, the laws of physics behave differently, so it can be difficult to understand how lithography works.

# Intro 

This app runs terraform as an .exe or on any desktop app.  This experimental app, built in Electron.js, is designed to explain lithography from the basics. It uses a simple simulation to show how light and electrons interact with materials at the nanoscale. 

The app is still under development, but it is already a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about lithography. It is also a great tool for students and researchers who are working on nanoscale applications.  

## How it works

LearnPhotolithography has 2 main components:
- A lessons screen that goes over how photolithography works including DUV and EUV methods to create microchips
- A lesson detail screen where you can see each animation with an explaintion including any relaventant graphs

## Stack:    

- The app LearnPhotolithography is written in JavaScript and Electron.js. and is aviable for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- The simulation uses the raytracing library Three.js.    

## Features
- Bilingual Resources: EN & ES 🌍🎓
- Nanoscale Litho Simulations 🔬🔄
- Dummifed text for rookies but yet indetais
