# Photolithography-101
lithography explained built in electron.js


 Photolithography is often performed at the nanoscale, where dimensions are measured in nanometers (billionths of a meter). Physcis doesn't really make sense at this scale so this app is built to explain how it works from the basics 


## run

``` npm build  ```
