# Photolithography-101
Lithography Experimental App Explained in Electron.js

<sub>The educational resources are provided in English and Spanish.  </sub>

Photolithography is a process used to create patterns on the surface of a material. It is often performed at the nanoscale, where dimensions are measured in nanometers (billionths of a meter). At this scale, the laws of physics behave differently, so it can be difficult to understand how lithography works.

This experimental app, built in Electron.js, is designed to explain lithography from the basics. It uses a simple simulation to show how light and electrons interact with materials at the nanoscale. 

The app is still under development, but it is already a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about lithography. It is also a great tool for students and researchers who are working on nanoscale applications.  

Here are some additional details about the app:  

The app is written in JavaScript and Electron.js.  
The simulation uses the raytracing library Three.js.  

The app is available for free on GitHub.
