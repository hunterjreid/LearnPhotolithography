    <strong>Exposure Systems and Light Sources</strong><br>
    Exposure systems are critical in photolithography, and they use various light sources to expose patterns on the wafer.

    <strong>Step 1: Light Sources</strong><br>
    Light sources, such as lasers and ultraviolet lamps, emit light of specific wavelengths required for the lithography process.

    <strong>Step 2: Collimation</strong><br>
    The light is collimated and directed towards the photomask.

    <strong>Step 3: Mask Illumination</strong><br>
    The collimated light passes through the photomask, which contains the pattern to be transferred.

    <strong>Step 4: Projection and Exposure</strong><br>
    The pattern is projected onto the wafer, exposing the photoresist and initiating the pattern transfer process.

    <strong>Applications</strong><br>
    Exposure systems are crucial in the fabrication of integrated circuits and advanced microelectronics.
