    <strong>Photomasks and Reticles</strong><br>
    Photomasks, also known as masks or reticles, are essential components in photolithography. They contain patterns that are transferred onto the wafer during the exposure process.

    <strong>Step 1: Design and Fabrication</strong><br>
    Photomasks are designed using specialized software. The patterns are then transferred onto a glass substrate coated with a chrome layer through a process called mask fabrication.

    <strong>Step 2: Alignment and Registration</strong><br>
    During the lithography process, the photomask is aligned and registered precisely with the wafer to ensure accurate pattern transfer.

    <strong>Step 3: Exposure</strong><br>
    The photomask is placed in the exposure system, and light shines through it onto the wafer, transferring the pattern onto the photoresist.

    <strong>Step 4: Reticles in Advanced Lithography</strong><br>
    In advanced lithography techniques such as multi-patterning, multiple reticles are used to create complex patterns.

    <strong>Applications</strong><br>
    Photomasks are used extensively in the semiconductor industry for manufacturing integrated circuits and microelectronic devices.
