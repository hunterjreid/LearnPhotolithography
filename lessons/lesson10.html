  <h1>Lesson 10: Future Lithography Techniques</h1>
  
  <div id="lesson-content">
    <h2>Introduction to Future Lithography</h2>
    <p>The field of microfabrication is continuously evolving, driven by the demand for smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient devices. As traditional photolithography approaches their limits, researchers and industry experts are exploring innovative techniques to overcome existing challenges and unlock new possibilities.</p>
    
    <h2>Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)</h2>
    <p>EUV lithography utilizes extremely short wavelengths of light in the EUV range to achieve higher resolution and more precise patterning. It has become a key contender for producing smaller features in semiconductor manufacturing.</p>
    
    <h2>Nanoimprint Lithography</h2>
    <p>Nanoimprint lithography involves pressing a template into a resist material to create nanoscale patterns. It offers high-resolution patterning and has potential applications in nanoelectronics, optics, and bioengineering.</p>
    
    <h2>Directed Self-Assembly (DSA)</h2>
    <p>DSA relies on the spontaneous arrangement of block copolymers into specific patterns. By controlling the interactions between different polymer segments, complex patterns can be formed at smaller scales.</p>
    
    <h2>Two-Photon Lithography</h2>
    <p>Two-photon lithography is a 3D printing technique that uses two-photon absorption to create intricate structures at the nanoscale. It enables the fabrication of complex 3D structures with high precision.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The future of lithography holds great promise, with these emerging techniques pushing the boundaries of what's achievable. As technology advances, we can anticipate even smaller and more sophisticated devices that will shape industries and our daily lives in ways we can't yet fully imagine.</p>
