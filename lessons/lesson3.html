    <strong>Step 1: Double Patterning</strong><br>
    Double patterning involves splitting a complex pattern into two separate masks, each patterned with a simpler lithography process.

    <strong>Step 2: Immersion Lithography</strong><br>
    Immersion lithography uses a liquid medium between the lens and the wafer to enhance resolution, allowing smaller features to be printed.

    <strong>Step 3: Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)</strong><br>
    EUV lithography uses extremely short wavelengths of light to achieve even finer resolution, enabling the production of advanced semiconductor devices.

    <strong>Step 4: Nanoimprint Lithography</strong><br>
    Nanoimprint lithography uses a template to physically imprint the pattern onto the photoresist, offering high resolution and cost-effective replication.

    <strong>Step 5: Directed Self-Assembly</strong><br>
    Directed self-assembly leverages molecular properties to guide the arrangement of block copolymers, creating precise patterns.

    <strong>Step 6: Computational Lithography</strong><br>
    Computational lithography involves using computer simulations to optimize mask designs and lithography processes for better pattern fidelity.

    <strong>Step 7: Metrology and Inspection</strong><br>
    Advanced techniques like scatterometry and electron microscopy are used for accurate measurement and inspection of patterns.

    <strong>Step 8: Resolution Enhancement Techniques</strong><br>
    Techniques like optical proximity correction (OPC) and phase-shifting masks further enhance pattern resolution.

    <strong>Step 9: Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAFs)</strong><br>
    SRAFs, smaller features added near main features, improve process latitude and reduce diffraction effects.

    <strong>Step 10: Multiple Patterning</strong><br>
    Multiple patterning splits patterns into simpler ones, achieving sub-resolution features.

    <strong>Step 11: Next-Generation Lithography</strong><br>
    Emerging technologies, such as nanolithography and DNA origami, offer innovative ways to achieve even smaller structures.
