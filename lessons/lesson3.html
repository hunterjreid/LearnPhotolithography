    <strong>Step 1: Double Patterning</strong><br>
    Double patterning involves splitting a complex pattern into two separate masks, each patterned with a simpler lithography process.

    <strong>Step 2: Immersion Lithography</strong><br>
    Immersion lithography uses a liquid medium between the lens and the wafer to enhance resolution, allowing smaller features to be printed.

    <strong>Step 10: Multiple Patterning</strong><br>
    Multiple patterning splits patterns into simpler ones, achieving sub-resolution features.

    <strong>Step 11: Next-Generation Lithography</strong><br>
    Emerging technologies, such as nanolithography and DNA origami, offer innovative ways to achieve even smaller structures.

    <p>Immersion lithography uses a liquid medium between the lens and the wafer to enhance resolution, allowing smaller features to be printed.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 3: Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)</strong></p>
    <p>EUV lithography uses extremely short wavelengths of light to achieve even finer resolution, enabling the production of advanced semiconductor devices.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 4: Nanoimprint Lithography</strong></p>
    <p>Nanoimprint lithography uses a template to physically imprint the pattern onto the photoresist, offering high resolution and cost-effective replication.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 5: Directed Self-Assembly</strong></p>
    <p>Directed self-assembly leverages molecular properties to guide the arrangement of block copolymers, creating precise patterns.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 6: Computational Lithography</strong></p>
    <p>Computational lithography involves using computer simulations to optimize mask designs and lithography processes for better pattern fidelity.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 7: Metrology and Inspection</strong></p>
    <p>Advanced techniques like scatterometry and electron microscopy are used for accurate measurement and inspection of patterns.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 8: Resolution Enhancement Techniques</strong></p>
    <p>Techniques like optical proximity correction (OPC) and phase-shifting masks further enhance pattern resolution.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 9: Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAFs)</strong></p>
    <p>SRAFs, smaller features added near main features, improve process latitude and reduce diffraction effects.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 10: Multiple Patterning</strong></p>
    <p>Multiple patterning splits patterns into simpler ones, achieving sub-resolution features.</p>
