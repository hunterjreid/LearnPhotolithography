  <div id="lesson-content">
    <p>Congratulations! You've completed Photolithography 101, a journey through the fundamental concepts and techniques of photolithography. Throughout these lessons, you've learned about photoresists, exposure processes, developing and etching, resolution enhancement techniques, and much more.</p>
    
    <p>Photolithography is a cornerstone of microfabrication, enabling the creation of intricate patterns used in electronics, photonics, MEMS, and more. By understanding the principles covered in these lessons, you're equipped to delve further into the world of microfabrication and nanotechnology.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, the field of photolithography is dynamic and ever-evolving. New technologies, materials, and techniques continue to push the boundaries of what's possible. Stay curious, keep learning, and you might just be a part of the next breakthrough!</p>
