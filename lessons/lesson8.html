  <h1>Lesson 8: Resolution Enhancement Techniques</h1>
  
  <div id="canvas-container"></div>
  
  <div id="lesson-content">
    <h2>Introduction to Resolution Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Resolution enhancement techniques are employed in photolithography to overcome the limitations of diffraction and improve the achievable resolution of patterns. These techniques play a crucial role in enabling the fabrication of smaller and more intricate structures.</p>
    
    <h2>Optical Proximity Correction (OPC)</h2>
    <p>OPC involves modifying the mask patterns to compensate for the distortion introduced during the imaging process. By reshaping the features on the mask, the final pattern can be optimized to achieve more accurate dimensions.</p>
    
    <h2>Phase-Shifting Masks</h2>
    <p>Phase-shifting masks use varying degrees of phase shifts to manipulate the interference of light waves. This results in constructive or destructive interference, enhancing the contrast and resolution of patterns.</p>
    
    <h2>Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAFs)</h2>
    <p>SRAFs are small auxiliary features added near main features to improve process latitude and pattern fidelity. They help to control the distribution of light and reduce the impact of diffraction effects.</p>
    
    <h2>Multiple Patterning</h2>
    <p>Multiple patterning techniques involve splitting a complex pattern into multiple simpler patterns that can be individually patterned with higher resolution. This enables the creation of sub-resolution features.</p>
