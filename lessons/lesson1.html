    <strong>Step 1: Substrate Preparation</strong><br>
    A silicon wafer is cleaned and chemically treated to remove impurities and create a smooth surface.

    <strong>Step 2: Spin-Coating of Photoresist</strong><br>
    A layer of light-sensitive photoresist is spin-coated onto the silicon wafer.

    <strong>Step 3: Soft Bake</strong><br>
    The coated wafer is baked at a low temperature to evaporate any solvent and pre-harden the photoresist.

    <strong>Step 4: Photomask Alignment</strong><br>
    A photomask with the desired pattern is accurately aligned over the wafer.

    <strong>Step 5: Exposure</strong><br>
    UV light shines through the photomask onto the photoresist-coated wafer, altering its solubility based on the pattern.

    <strong>Step 6: Post-Exposure Bake</strong><br>
    Another baking process stabilizes the exposed photoresist pattern.

    <strong>Step 7: Development</strong><br>
    The wafer is immersed in a developer solution to remove the exposed or unexposed photoresist, revealing the pattern.

    <strong>Step 8: Etching</strong><br>
    The exposed areas of the wafer are chemically etched away to create the desired features.

    <strong>Step 9: Photoresist Strip</strong><br>
    The remaining photoresist, no longer needed, is stripped from the wafer.

    <strong>Step 10: Repeat for Multiple Layers</strong><br>
    Optionally, these steps are repeated to create multiple layers in semiconductor devices.
